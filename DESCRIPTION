Description: This package is used for the reconstruction of Time Series with the use of the functions
    geoRts: function that allows the reconstruction of Time Series through the distance 
    matrix (positions) forming the gravitational matrix with the help of the characteris-
    tic weights of each series.
    DistribEmpirica: it is a step function that jumps by 1/N to the occurrence of each 
    time series.
    rts_clean: data cleaning and data reconstruction.
    rts_plotClean: drawing of the complete series. 
    rEmpirica: simulates the Empirical Distribution function "DistribEmpirica".
    rts_plotGroup: takes the original time series and the reconstructed and graphic time
    series.
    rts_plot: graph for an individual time series.
