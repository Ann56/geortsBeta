Description: contains the implementation of methodology created with the objective of 
    the reconstruction of geographical time series from an interpolation-simulation 
    model based on IDW (Inverse distance weighted), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), 
    STL-Loess (Local Regression ) and Monte Carlo simulation. The package has functions 
    for cleaning time series with missing values, simulation of stationary processes based 
    on their empirical distribution, in addition to the interpolation of the values of these 
    series locally, likewise, it has tools for the visualization of series of time (Images, 
    png, jpg, pdf, vector)), its spatial (geographical) representation and the combination 
    of both visualizations in 3D animation format (spacetime).
